# SPP2 Underpayment Calculation Tools

This directory contains two tools for calculating underpayment owed to continuing providers between the SPP2 start date (May 26, 2025 11:53 PM UTC) and when their stream is activated.

## Why Underpayment?

Continuing providers are entitled to SPP2 rates starting May 26, 2025 at 11:53 PM UTC. However, their actual streams might be activated days or weeks later. These tools calculate the compensation owed for that gap period.

| Namehash Labs                | 600,000   | 1,100,000 | +500,000   | +1,368.93 USDC/day |

| Ethereum Identity Foundation | 500,000   | 500,000   | No change  | 0 USDC/day         |
| Namespace                    | 200,000   | 400,000   | +200,000   | +547.57 USDC/day   |

## Underpayment Calculation Formula

```
Underpayment = Daily Rate Difference Ã— Time Elapsed

Where:
- Daily Rate Difference = (SPP2 Annual Rate - SPP1 Annual Rate) / 365
- Time Elapsed = Stream Activation DateTime - May 26, 2025 11:53 PM UTC
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Date Only

If Namehash Labs' stream is activated on June 10, 2025 (midnight):

- Time period: 14 days, 0.1 hours
- Daily difference: 1,368.93 USDC
- **Total underpayment: 19,171.61 USDC**

### Example 2: Date + Time

If Namehash Labs' stream is activated on June 10, 2025 at 2:30 PM UTC:

- Time period: 14 days, 14.6 hours
- Daily difference: 1,368.93 USDC
- **Total underpayment: 19,998.67 USDC**

The extra 14.6 hours adds 827.06 USDC in additional underpayment compensation.
